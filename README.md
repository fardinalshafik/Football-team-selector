# ⚽ Football Team Selector  

A **C++ console-based application** that allows users to select a football team from a list of available players. The program then automatically selects the best XI for the compiler’s team and displays both lineups.  

## Features 🏆  
✔️ User can choose their own team from a list of players.  
✔️ The program selects the best XI for the opposing team.  
✔️ Displays both user-selected and compiler-selected teams.  

## How It Works 🛠️  
1️⃣ The program presents a list of players.  
2️⃣ The user selects players to form their team.  
3️⃣ The compiler picks its best XI.  
4️⃣ Both teams are displayed at the end.  

## Future Improvements 🚀  
🔹 More formations (e.g., 4-3-3, 4-4-2).  
🔹 Smarter AI selection using data structures.  
🔹 User-friendly text-based UI for better readability.  
🔹 Option to restart the selection after finishing a match.
